## About
This project is under construction...
</br>
</br>
This is a full-stack movie application using Next JS's pre-rendering features.
</br>
I did this project to get a more profound knowledge about Next JS and graphQL, as well as explore more about animations in a bit more extensive application (which differs a bit from just a single animation).
</br>
</br>
I hope you like it.
